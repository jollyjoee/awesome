1. Hello
2. How are you doing
3. Change %Fileversion% in test app to be the same as your version here in the repository to stop this popup.
4. Normally you would upload your file to this repository, get the raw download link, and paste the link onto the script on line #55
this will make the "ok" button download the latest version uploaded (which will then have the matching %Fileversion% to stop the update popup and ultimately install the udpate.
